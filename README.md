Exploration of Labor Force Participation Rate Graphs

Note that to run this yourself, you should set the parameters yourself in the beginning of the file, particularly homedir, your working directory for this project.

Also note that the series names are hard-coded in this file. To the best of my understanding, one cannot easily download a list. The following is indicative of this:

"I don't know the series ID(s) for the data I want to access. How do I find the  ID(s)?
The BLS Public Data API requires users to know the series ID to request data. We do not currently have a catalogue of series IDs, but all BLS series IDs follow a similar format."

Also, I do not plot all the series here, so that one doesn't bump up against the API v1 daily limit. There are two versions of the API. For v1, one doesn't need credentials, but there are lower limits. One needs credentials for v2, and I did not want to do that here.
